routing-engine
==============

Routing engine for use with I Bike CPH and Spoiled Milk fork of RMMapView

You should add <b>smroute_setting.plist file</b> to the application that is using routing-engine. You can find example of such file in this dir (<b>smroute_settings_example.plist</b>). 

Routing-engine will also read <b>smroute_setting_private.plist</b>. A file called <b>EXAMPLE_smroute_settings_private.plist</b> has been placed in the same folder to get you started. Just copy it to <b>smroute_settings_private.plist</b> and change the info. <b>
<br/>DO NOT CHANGE THE EXAMPLE FILE AND COMMIT IT. YOUR LOGIN INFO WILL END UP IN THE REPOSITORY FOR ALL TO SEE.</b></p>
