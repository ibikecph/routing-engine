routing-engine
==============

In application that is using routing-engine you should add smroute_setting.plist file. You can find example of such file in this dir (smroute_settings_example.plist). 
Routing-engine will also read smroute_setting_private.plist. Idea is that you can split settings in two files (in case that you need such option) and commit/push only one and leave the other.


Routing engine for use with I Bike CPH and Spoiled Milk fork of RMMapView
